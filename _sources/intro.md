# Welcome to Sudeepthi Rongali's Data Science Portfolio

Hello and thank you for visiting my Jupyter Book! This portfolio showcases my academic and professional journey as a Data Science student at the University at Buffalo. 

Inside, you will find a curated selection of my projects, including hands-on machine learning applications, real-time data analysis pipelines, and innovative research contributions. Each project highlights the tools, techniques, and skills I have developed throughout my studies and internships.  

This book serves as a central hub to explore my resume, technical skills, project notebooks, and certifications.
